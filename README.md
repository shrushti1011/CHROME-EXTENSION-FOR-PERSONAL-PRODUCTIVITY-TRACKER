#Description :

*FocusFlow: A Chrome Extension for Personal Productivity Tracking
FocusFlow is an advanced Chrome extension designed to help users improve personal productivity by combining time management, task tracking, 
and website activity monitoring in one unified interface. Built with a modern technology stack and a clean, responsive UI, FocusFlow supports users in setting daily goals,
maintaining focus, and visualizing their productivity trends.

At the heart of FocusFlow lies a Pomodoro-style Focus Timer. This feature allows users to work in focused 25-minute sessions followed by short breaks. Each session is tracked, 
and the system maintains a count of completed sessions to promote consistent work habits. This technique helps reduce mental fatigue and boosts concentration.

In addition to time tracking, FocusFlow includes a powerful To-Do List that enables users to manage tasks effectively. Users can add, complete, and remove tasks as their day progresses. 
This supports goal-oriented behavior and aligns with the daily productivity workflow.

A Daily Inspiration feature offers motivational quotes each day to encourage a positive mindset and help users start their day on a productive note. Additionally, a Quick Links section allows users to save frequently visited websites (such as Gmail, GitHub, or YouTube), improving accessibility and workflow efficiency.

One of the most impactful features of FocusFlow is its ability to monitor and visualize browsing activity using the Chrome Extension APIs. It tracks the time spent on different websites, categorizes them, and presents the data visually—helping users recognize unproductive patterns and minimize distractions.
